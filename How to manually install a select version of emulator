How to manually install a select version of emulator
To manually install a select version of emulator on Studio, you need to paste the desired emulator package contents into your SDK installation directory, and change the emulator version specified in the package.xml file. Specifically, follow these steps:

Locate your SDK installation directory. The default location of this directory varies by platform:
On Windows, it's the %LocalAppData%\Android\Sdk directory. This normally expands to C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk, although it might vary based on your system.
On macOS, it's the $HOME/Library/Android/sdk directory.
On Linux, it's the $HOME/Android/Sdk directory.
You can check where your SDK installation directory is by opening Studio and clicking Android Studio > Preferences > Appearances & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK. The Android SDK Location file path is your SDK installation directory location.

If you're using macOS and browsing using Finder, the Library folder might not be visible by default. To navigate there, open Finder and click Go > Go to Folder and search for "Library."

Rename the existing emulator directory in the SDK installation directory, because you'll unzip the newly downloaded emulator directory here in the next step. For example, call it emulator_original.
Unzip the emulator zip file you downloaded. Move the contents into the SDK installation directory.
For Mac M1 (Apple Silicon) users: After unzipping the emulator zip file, clear the quarantine attribute on the emulator package by running:

xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine emulator/
This should reduce messages about whether the package should be checked or blocked.

Paste the package.xml file from the emulator_original directory into the new emulator directory.
Change the emulator version specified in the package.xml file to the version you have downloaded and want to use. To do this, scroll to the bottom of the package.xml file and find the text that looks like:

<revision><major>31</major><minor>1</minor><micro>4</micro></revision>
This is where you should specify the emulator version you downloaded and want to install.
